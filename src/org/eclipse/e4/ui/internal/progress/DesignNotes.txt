3/22/14 - Need to find a way to break up the singleton pattern used here and provide
the instances through the context.  Not sure at what level they should be inserted
into the context - assuming the application level, but I can see how some perspectives
may need their own Jobs.

Current list of singletons:
1. AnimationManager
2. FinishedJobs
3. ProgressManager
4. ProgressViewUpdater

The entire Jobs View depends on org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job so it may not be
feasible to maintain separate lists of Jobs.

LabelDecorator? 

Actions - 
Workbench Images - Need to pull the image resources used in the Progress View into the bundle for the view.

Need to correct the capability that runs a command after the job completes.
